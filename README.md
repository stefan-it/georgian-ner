# English-Georgian NER Model with Flair

We fine-tune a NER Model with Flair on English and Georgian training splits of WikiANN dataset (Rahimi splits).

Based on [this repository](https://github.com/stefan-it/autotrain-flair-mobie) the fine-tuning is done with the
awesome [Flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair) library, incl. support for Hugging Face's [AutoTrain](https://github.com/huggingface/autotrain-advanced).

We use a basic hyper-parameter search with the following configuration:

| Parameter     | Value             |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Learning Rate | `5e-06`           |
| Batch Size    | `4`               |
| Epoch         | `10`              |
| Seeds         | `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` |

We use [XLM-R Large](https://huggingface.co/xlm-roberta-large) as base model.

The following environment variables needs to be set when using AutoTrain:

| Environment Variable | Description                                                                                       |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `HF_TOKEN`           | Hugging Face User Access Token, which can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) |
| `HUB_ORG_NAME`       | Username or organization under models will be uploaded to                                         |

The fine-tuning can then be started by running the `script.py` script.
